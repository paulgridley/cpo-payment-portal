## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Replit Git Interface
1. Look for Git tab in left sidebar
2. Click "Push" or "Sync" to GitHub
3. If authentication fails, reconnect GitHub in settings

### Option 2: Manual Upload
1. Download latest-changes.tar.gz
2. Extract locally
3. Push to GitHub from your computer

### Option 3: Force CLI (Advanced)
If you have Git expertise, you can try:
```bash
# Remove lock files (if you understand the risks)
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## Recommended: Use Replit's Git Interface
The safest approach is using Replit's built-in Git tools rather than CLI.
